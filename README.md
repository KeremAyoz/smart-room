# SmartRoom

Multi-platform IoT Application that controls various devices in a room. It uses Arduino Yun and Raspberry Pi to control room locally. Desktop app can be used to control the room remotely.

Desktop app can receive voice commands to control devices in the room. IBM Watson Services are used in that project.

## Demo

* Execute JAR file to test desktop application.
* Load SmartRoom.ino to Arduino Yun to test its functionality.
* Execute Python code in Raspberry Pi to test.

### Notes: 
* All these applications are connected to an IBM Account, so account may be inactive which may give wrong results in tests.
* You must have internet connection in all the devices.
